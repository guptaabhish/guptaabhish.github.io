My research interests are focused on exploration of techniques for enabling high

performance and secure cloud computing. The idea of a cloud as an elastic, pay-as-you-
go infrastructure is appealing to a large number of researcher organizations and

companies that find installing hardware of their own to be prohibitively expensive, or at

least more expensive than â€œrenting" compute capabilities in the cloud as they need them.

<br>
Cloud facilities are easiest to use when you are running (one or many) single-node jobs.

However, much of technical computing involves multi-node jobs that are much more tightly

coupled, i.e., they involve frequent synchronizing communication between nodes. The

typical high latencies and communication variability of cloud-based clusters make it hard

to get good, or even reasonable, performance for many HPC applications. Further, the

static and dynamic heterogeneities, as well as price variations, presented by cloud

infrastructures also hinder performance and cost-effectiveness.
<br>

Loss of control, lack of trust, and multi-tenancy result in security challenges moving from

on-premise infrastructure to cloud. Due to above challenges, the tremendous potential of

cloud for scientific and industrial analytical computing have largely remained unutilized.

Novel techniques need to be investigated to bridge the gap between cloud computing and

High performance Computing (HPC).
