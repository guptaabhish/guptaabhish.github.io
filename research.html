I work on understanding HPC network behavior for scalable application execution, interoperation of Charm++ and other paradigms such as MPI and OpenMP, topology aware mapping, load balancing, further development of Charm++ RTS and optimization of Adaptive MPI . I also like to develop collective algorithms for different network topologies, and am interested in exploring machine learning algorithms.

<br>

Current Projects- Offline network behavior prediction; Interoperation of languages; Understanding torus networks for communication bound applications; Replica logic in Charm for NAMD and fault tolerance; MPI profiling and topology aware communicators; Unified API for Topology discovery; AMPI optimization; Collectives on two-tier networks.

Career at IBM- Prior to joining PPL, I was a member of the High Performance Computing Group, managed by Dr. Yogish Sabharwal, in IBM Research-India. While at IBM, I worked on HPCC benchmark optimization for IBM's Blue Gene series, developing algorithms for MPI Collectives and scalability of scientific and real life applications.
